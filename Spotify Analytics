# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using SQL to answer the following questions.


#1. What is(are) the most popular track(s), and which artist(s) released it(them)?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity 
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE popularity = (SELECT MAX(popularity) FROM Spotifydata)


#2. What are the Top 10 artists based on song popularity?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10


#3. Which artists have more than 1 song in the top 50 most listened to songs on Spotify in 2021, and how many songs do they each have?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_id) AS tracks 
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING tracks>1
ORDER BY tracks desc


#4. Which artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms IN (SELECT MAX(duration_ms) FROM Spotifydata)



#5. What is the average danceability of the top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS top10_danceability
FROM (SELECT danceability 
  FROM Spotifydata
  ORDER BY popularity DESC
  LIMIT 10)


#6. What is the average length of the top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(duration_ms) AS top10_duration
FROM (SELECT duration_ms 
        FROM Spotifydata
        ORDER by popularity DESC
        LIMIT 10)

#7. What artists have an average popularity of 90 or above? Label them as "Top Star".
WITH pop_avg_CTE AS(
  SELECT s.artist_name, avg(s.popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name, avg_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM pop_avg_CTE
WHERE avg_popularity>=90;
