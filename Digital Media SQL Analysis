##For this project, I worked with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes 
tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

##Raw data for this database can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql

## I performed analytics on this dataset to gain answers to the following questions:
  

#1. Show how many customers are in each country. Which country has the most customers?

SELECT distinct country
,COUNT(CustomerID) 
FROM chinook.customers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;



#2. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName
,LastName
,CustomerId
,Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "USA"


  
#3. Show only the customers from France.

SELECT FirstName
,LastName,
CustomerId
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "France";



#4. Find the Invoices of customers who are from France. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName
,cust.LastName
,inv.InvoiceId
,inv.InvoiceDate
,inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "France";



#5. Show the employee titles, and how many of each employee hold each title. 

SELECT distinct title
,COUNT(Employeeid) 
FROM chinook.employees
GROUP BY title;



#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT e.FirstName
,e.LastName
,i.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.SupportRepId = e.Employeeid 
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId;



#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT e.FirstName As "Employee First Name"
,e.LastName AS "Employee Last Name"
,c.FirstName AS "Customer First Name"
,c.LastName AS "Customer Last Name"
,c.Country 
,i.Total
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
  


#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "2009%"

  

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "2009%"

  

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name
,i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i 
ON t.TrackId= i.TrackId;


#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT ar.name as Artist
,t.Name as Track
, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.TrackId = t. TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID = a.ArtistID

  

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name'
,a.Title AS 'Album Name'
,m.Name AS 'Media Type'
,g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.AlbumId = a. AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.GenreId = t. Genreid;



#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.FirstName
,e.LastName
,ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId 
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.FirstName;



#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.FirstName
,e.LastName
,ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId 
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE i.InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' DESC
LIMIT 1
  


#15. Which genre has the highest number of tracks sold?

SELECT g.Name AS 'Genre'
,SUM(i.Quantity) AS 'Total Tracks Sold'
FROM chinook.genres g
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON g.GenreId = t. Genreid
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
GROUP BY g.Name
ORDER BY SUM(i.Quantity) DESC
LIMIT 1
